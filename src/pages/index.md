    Whether bringing an idea from a napkin to a product or unraveling a codebase
    abandoned by a engineer, I'm here to help you get your job done the way you want it, pronto! Consulting isn't about spouting opinions, it's about 
    rolling up sleeves and delivering results. And if it's not, then I don't do consulting!

  Having broad experience with a wide array of technologies lends perspective 
  when choosing a stack for a greenfield project or dealing with legacy code.
  Whether you're building a static website or a fully functional full-stack app 
  with mobile and web components, you've come to the right place.

      title: Front End
      text: >
        Frontend web design is no longer just the judicious application of HTML, CSS 
        and JavaScript. The framework selection alone can be overwealming before
        you begin to think about design systems, hosting, SSL, dynamic content, responsive design and accessability. But fear not, we got you covered.

      title: Back End
      text: >
        The core of any product is the application logic and associated database that users and customers interact with.  
        But backends can get bogged down in all kinds of issues including security, performance and infrastructure costs. 
        And as codebases grow, they need to be reconsidered to address the issues of scale that come with your growing business.

        Great ideas are not always 100% digital and sometimes you need a physical object to acheieve your goals. 
        Light robotics, sensors, actuators, lights and sounds can all be internet connected and ready to create the widget of the future.
