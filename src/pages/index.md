        Great ideas are not always digital; sometimes you need a physical object to achieve your goals. 
        Our unique background in architecture, mathmatics and computation make us expert builders, too. 
        Light robotics, sensors, actuators, lights and sounds can all be internet-connected to create the widget of your dreams.

      text: >
        Frontend web design is no longer just the judicious application of HTML, CSS 
        and JavaScript. The framework selection alone can be overwealming before
        you begin to consier your design systems, hosting, SSL, dynamic content, 
        responsive design and accessability. But fear not, we got you covered.

      title: Back End
      text: >
        Backends can get bogged down with problems like security, performance and infrastructure costs. 
        And as codebases grow, they need to be reconsidered to address the issues of scale that come with your growing business. 
        Our job is to anticipate problems and stay on top of them.
